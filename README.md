## Setting Up React Hooks

1. ### useState
   
	`useState` is one of the most commonly used React hooks, introduced in React 16.8. It allows functional components to manage and update their internal state, making them dynamic and responsive. With `useState`, you can declare state variables and easily update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.
	
	**Example of  `useState`  in React**
	   
	 Here's a simple example of how to use `useState` in a React functional component:
	
	```javascript
	         import React, { useState } from 'react';
	
	         function Counter() {
	         // Declare a state variable named "count" with an initial value of 0
	         const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	            
	         // Event handler to increment the count
	         const incrementCount = () => {
	            setCount(count + 1);
	         };
	            
	         // Event handler to reset the count
	         const resetCount = () => {
	               setCount(0);
	         };
	            
	         return (
	            <div>
	               <p>Count: {count}</p>
	               <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
	               <button onClick={resetCount}>Reset</button>
	            </div>
	               );
	            }
	            
	            export default Counter;
	```
	      
	In this example, we create a `Counter` component using the `useState` hook. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:
	
	1.  We import React and the `useState` hook from the 'react' library.
	         
	2.  Inside the `Counter` component, we declare a state variable named `count` using the `useState` hook. The initial value of `count` is set to 0. The `useState` function returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update that state (`setCount`).
	         
	3.  We define two event handlers, `incrementCount` and `resetCount`, which use the `setCount` function to update the `count` state. When `setCount` is called, it triggers a re-render of the component with the new state value.
	         
	4.  In the component's JSX, we display the current count value, and there are two buttons. Clicking the "Increment" button calls the `incrementCount` function, and clicking the "Reset" button calls the `resetCount` function, updating the count accordingly.
	                
	            
	 The `useState` hook simplifies state management in functional components, making it easy to handle and update component-specific data. It allows you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces without the need for class components or complex state management code.
	   
	
	**[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
   
2. ### useReducer

	`useReducer` is a React hook that is used to manage state in a more structured and predictable way. It is especially useful when you have state that depends on the previous state and when you need to handle complex state transitions and logic.
	
	**Example of  `useReducer` in React**
	
	Here's an example of how to use `useReducer` in a React functional component:
	   
	```javascript
	      import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
	      
	      // Define a reducer function
	      function counterReducer(state, action) {
	        switch (action.type) {
	          case 'increment':
	            return { count: state.count + 1 };
	          case 'decrement':
	            return { count: state.count - 1 };
	          default:
	            return state;
	        }
	      }
	      
	      function Counter() {
	        const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
	      
	        return (
	          <div>
	            <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
	            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
	            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
	          </div>
	        );
	      }
	      
	      export default Counter;
	```
	In this example, we create a counter component using the `useReducer` hook. The `counterReducer` function defines how the state should be updated based on different actions, and the `dispatch` function is used to dispatch these actions.
	
	State Hooks, whether `useState` or `useReducer`, have transformed the way we handle state in React. They have brought simplicity, clarity, and reusability to state management, making React applications more efficient and maintainable.
	
	In this article, we'll explore these hooks in greater depth, provide examples of their usage, and discuss best practices to help you become proficient in managing state in your React applications.
	
	**[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
	
3. ### useContext

	`useContext` is a React hook that allows functional components to access context values. Context in React is a way to share data that can be considered "global" to a component tree, without manually passing it through props at each level.
	
	**Example of  `useContext` in React**

   	In this example, we'll create a simple theme-switching application that uses `useContext` to share the current theme throughout the component tree.
	
	**Step 1: Create a Theme Context**
	
	First, define a theme context with an initial theme value:
	      
	```javascript
	   // ThemeContext.js
	   import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';
	   
	   const ThemeContext = createContext();
	   
	   export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
	     const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
	   
	     const toggleTheme = () => {
	       setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
	     };
	   
	     return (
	       <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
	         {children}
	       </ThemeContext.Provider>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   export function useTheme() {
	     return useContext(ThemeContext);
	   }
	   
	```
	In this code:

   	-   We create a `ThemeContext` using the `createContext` function.
	-   We define a `ThemeProvider` component that manages the theme state and provides the theme value and a function to toggle the theme using the `useState` hook.
	-   The `useTheme` custom hook allows us to easily access the theme and toggle function.
	   
	**Step 2: Using `useContext` to Consume the Context**
	   
	Now, let's use the theme context in our components:
	
	```javascript
	   // App.js
	   import React from 'react';
	   import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from './ThemeContext';
	   import ThemeSwitcher from './ThemeSwitcher';
	   
	   function App() {
	     return (
	       <ThemeProvider>
	         <div className="App">
	           <Header />
	           <Content />
	         </div>
	       </ThemeProvider>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   function Header() {
	     const { theme } = useTheme();
	   
	     return (
	       <header className={`header ${theme}`}>
	         <h1>My Theme App</h1>
	         <ThemeSwitcher />
	       </header>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   function Content() {
	     const { theme } = useTheme();
	   
	     return (
	       <div className={`content ${theme}`}>
	         <p>This is the content of my app.</p>
	       </div>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   export default App;
	```
	In this code:
	   
	-   We wrap our `App` component with the `ThemeProvider`, which provides the theme context.
	-   Inside the `Header` and `Content` components, we use the `useTheme` custom hook to access the theme value.
	-   The theme value is applied to the `className` of the elements, allowing us to switch between "light" and "dark" themes.
	   
	**Step 3: Create the ThemeSwitcher Component**
	   
	Let's create a component to switch between themes:
	
	```javascript
	   // ThemeSwitcher.js
	   import React from 'react';
	   import { useTheme } from './ThemeContext';
	   
	   function ThemeSwitcher() {
	     const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
	   
	     return (
	       <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
	         Switch to {theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
	       </button>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   export default ThemeSwitcher;
	   
	```
	In this component, we use the `useTheme` custom hook to access the `theme` and `toggleTheme` function to switch between light and dark themes.
	   
	By using the `useContext` hook along with a custom hook, you can efficiently access and manage shared state or data within your React application without the need for prop drilling, making your code more maintainable and clean.

4. ### useEffect
   
	`useEffect` is a React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It's equivalent to the lifecycle methods `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components. With `useEffect`, you can execute code after the component has rendered and react to changes in props and state.
	   
	**Example of `useEffect` in React**
	   
	In this example, we'll create a simple React component that fetches and displays data from an API when the component is mounted.
	   
	```javascript
	   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
	   
	   function DataFetchingComponent() {
	     const [data, setData] = useState([]);
	     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
	   
	     useEffect(() => {
	       // This code block runs after the component has rendered
	       fetch('https://api.example.com/data') // Replace with your API endpoint
	         .then((response) => response.json())
	         .then((result) => {
	           setData(result);
	           setLoading(false);
	         })
	         .catch((error) => {
	           console.error('Error fetching data: ', error);
	           setLoading(false);
	         });
	     }, []); // The empty dependency array means this effect runs only on component mount
	   
	     return (
	       <div>
	         {loading ? (
	           <p>Loading...</p>
	         ) : (
	           <ul>
	             {data.map((item) => (
	               <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
	             ))}
	           </ul>
	         )}
	       </div>
	     );
	   }
	   
	   export default DataFetchingComponent;
	   
	```
	In this code:
	   
	-   We import React, `useState`, and `useEffect` from 'react'.
	-   We create a functional component called `DataFetchingComponent`.
	-   Inside the component, we declare state variables `data` and `loading` using the `useState` hook.
	-   We use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from an API when the component is mounted. The empty dependency array `[]` indicates that this effect should only run once after the initial render.
	   
	  Here's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening:
	   
	1.  When the component is mounted, the `useEffect` code block fetches data from the API using the `fetch` function.
	       
	2.  Once the data is fetched, it's processed, and the state is updated using the `setData` and `setLoading` functions, which triggers a re-render.
 	3.   The component renders either a "Loading..." message or a list of data items based on the `loading` state.
	       
	   
	Using `useEffect`, you can easily manage asynchronous operations, data fetching, and other side effects within your functional components. It helps keep your components clean, efficient, and responsive to changes.
	   
	**[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
	      
5. ### useLayoutEffect
   
   `useLayoutEffect` is a React Hook that is similar to `useEffect`. The key difference is the timing of when the effect runs. `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after the DOM is mutated but before the browser repaints. This makes it ideal for tasks that require immediate DOM changes.
   
   **Example of `useLayoutEffect` in React**
   
   In this example, we'll create a React component that uses `useLayoutEffect` to change the background color of a button element immediately after it's rendered. This demonstrates how `useLayoutEffect` can be useful for tasks that require changes to the DOM before it's painted.
   
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';
   
   function ButtonComponent() {
     const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState('white');
   
     useLayoutEffect(() => {
       setBackgroundColor('blue'); // Change the background color immediately after rendering
     }, []); // The empty dependency array means this effect runs only once after the initial render
   
     return (
       <button style={{ backgroundColor }}>Click me</button>
     );
   }
   
   export default ButtonComponent;
   
   ```
   In this code:
   
   -   We import React, `useState`, and `useLayoutEffect` from 'react'.
   -   We create a functional component called `ButtonComponent`.
   -   Inside the component, we declare a state variable `backgroundColor` using the `useState` hook.
   
   The key part is the `useLayoutEffect`:
   
   1.  The `useLayoutEffect` code block changes the `backgroundColor` state variable to 'blue' immediately after rendering, thanks to the synchronous nature of `useLayoutEffect`.
       
   2.  The component renders a button element with a dynamic background color based on the `backgroundColor` state.
       
   
   When the component is rendered, the button's background color changes to 'blue' without waiting for the next browser paint. This demonstrates how `useLayoutEffect` can be useful for tasks that require immediate DOM changes, ensuring a smoother user experience.
   
   Keep in mind that, in most cases, you'll use the standard `useEffect` hook for handling side effects, as it doesn't block the painting phase. `useLayoutEffect` is generally used for very specific scenarios where synchronous DOM mutations are required.
   
      **[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
      
6. ### useDebugValue
   
   `useDebugValue` is a hook that enables you to provide additional information about your custom hooks for React DevTools. It's particularly useful when creating custom hooks that encapsulate complex logic or state management, making it easier to understand and debug the behavior of these hooks.
   
   **Example of `useDebugValue` in a Custom Hook**
   
   In this example, we'll create a simple custom hook called `useCounter` that counts and displays a value. We'll use `useDebugValue` to provide a label for React DevTools.
   
   ```javascript
   import { useState, useEffect, useDebugValue } from 'react';
   
   function useCounter(initialValue) {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
   
     useEffect(() => {
       document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
     }, [count]);
   
     useDebugValue(count, (count) => `Custom Counter: ${count}`); // Debug label
   
     return { count, increment: () => setCount(count + 1) };
   }
   
   export default useCounter;
   
   ```
   In this code:
   
   -   We import React's `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useDebugValue` hooks.
       
   -   We create a custom hook named `useCounter` that takes an initial value and returns an object with the current `count` value and an `increment` function to increase the count.
       
   -   Inside the `useEffect`, we update the document title with the current count whenever the `count` changes.
       
   -   The key part is the `useDebugValue` hook. We use it to provide a label and value for React DevTools. This allows you to see a more informative label in DevTools when inspecting this custom hook. The custom label is created based on the count value.
       
   
   **Using the `useCounter` custom hook**
   
   Now, you can use the `useCounter` custom hook in your components:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import useCounter from './useCounter';
   
   function CounterComponent() {
     const counter = useCounter(0);
   
     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {counter.count}</p>
         <button onClick={counter.increment}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default CounterComponent;
   
   ```
   In this component, we use the `useCounter` custom hook to manage the count state and increment function. The custom label provided by `useDebugValue` will be visible in React DevTools when inspecting the `useCounter` hook.
   
   This example demonstrates how `useDebugValue` can be used to improve the debugging experience when creating custom hooks by providing informative labels for custom hooks in React DevTools. It's especially helpful for hooks that encapsulate complex logic or state management.

7. ### useRef
	
	`useRef` is a Hook that provides a way to reference and interact with DOM elements and other values in a functional component. It is commonly used when you need to access the underlying DOM, manage values that don't trigger re-renders, or perform actions that require direct manipulation.
	
	**Example of `useRef` in React**
		
	In this example, we'll use `useRef` to focus an input element when the component mounts:
		
	```javascript
		import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
		
		function FocusInput() {
		  // Create a ref to store a reference to the input element
		  const inputRef = useRef(null);
		
		  // Use useEffect to focus the input element when the component mounts
		  useEffect(() => {
		    inputRef.current.focus();
		  }, []);
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <p>Click the button to focus the input field:</p>
		      <input ref={inputRef} />
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		
		export default FocusInput;
		
	```
		
	In this code:
		
	-   We import React, `useRef`, and `useEffect` from 'react'.
		    
	-   Inside the `FocusInput` component, we create a ref using `useRef`. The initial value of the ref is set to `null`.
		    
	-   We use the `useEffect` hook to focus the input element when the component mounts. We do this by calling `inputRef.current.focus()`.
		    
	-   In the component's JSX, we render a paragraph and an input field. We attach the `inputRef` to the `ref` attribute of the input element.
		    
	-   When the component mounts, the `useEffect` is triggered, and it calls `inputRef.current.focus()`, which focuses the input field.
		    
		
	This is just a basic example of how to use `useRef` to access and interact with DOM elements. You can also use `useRef` to store and manipulate values, including custom data, without causing re-renders in your component. `useRef` is a versatile tool for handling various scenarios in React.

8. ### useImperativeHandle
	
	`useImperativeHandle` is a Hook that gives you control over what is exposed when a parent component uses a `ref` to access a child component. It allows you to customize the instance value that the parent component sees, making it possible to expose only the methods or properties that are relevant.
		
	**Example of `useImperativeHandle` in React**
		
	**Child Component (Child.js):**
		
	```javascript
		import React, { useImperativeHandle, forwardRef } from 'react';
		
		const Child = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  // Create a local variable
		  let count = 0;
		
		  // Define a function that increments the count
		  const incrementCount = () => {
		    count += 1;
		  };
		
		  // Expose the incrementCount function to the parent component
		  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
		    incrementCount,
		  }));
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <p>Child Component</p>
		    </div>
		  );
		});
		
		export default Child;
		
	```
		
	In this code:
		
	-   We import React, `useImperativeHandle`, and `forwardRef` from 'react'.
		    
	-   We create a functional child component called `Child`.
		    
	-   Inside the `Child` component, we define a local variable `count` and a function `incrementCount` that increments the `count`.
		    
	-   We use `useImperativeHandle` to expose the `incrementCount` function to the parent component via the `ref`. This means the parent can access and call the `incrementCount` function on the child component.
		
	**Parent Component (Parent.js):**
		
	```javascript
		import React, { useRef } from 'react';
		import Child from './Child';
		
		function Parent() {
		  const childRef = useRef();
		
		  const handleIncrement = () => {
		    childRef.current.incrementCount();
		  };
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <p>Parent Component</p>
		      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment Child Count</button>
		      <Child ref={childRef} />
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		
		export default Parent;
		
	```
		
	In this code:
		
	-   We create a parent component called `Parent`.
		    
	-   Inside the `Parent` component, we use `useRef` to create a `childRef` that we will use to access the child component.
		    
	-   We define a function `handleIncrement` that calls the `incrementCount` function on the child component when a button is clicked.
		    
	-   The `Child` component is rendered with a `ref` attribute that points to the `childRef`. This allows the parent to access the child component and call the `incrementCount` function.
		    
		
	When you click the "Increment Child Count" button in the parent component, it calls the `incrementCount` function in the child component, incrementing the `count` variable in the child. This demonstrates how `useImperativeHandle` allows you to expose specific methods or properties of a child component to its parent, providing greater control and encapsulation of functionality.

9. ###  useCallback
		
	`useCallback` is a React Hook that memoizes a function, creating a memoized version of the function that will only change if its dependencies change. This is beneficial when you want to optimize performance by avoiding re-creating functions on each render, especially when those functions are passed as props to child components.
	
	**Example of `useCallback` in React**
		
	In this example, we'll create a simple counter application with two buttons, and we'll use `useCallback` to optimize the event handler functions.
	
	```javascript
	import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
	
	function Counter() {
	  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	
	  // Create memoized event handlers with useCallback
	  const increment = useCallback(() => {
	    setCount(count + 1);
	  }, [count]);
	
	  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
	    setCount(count - 1);
	  }, [count]);
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <p>Count: {count}</p>
	      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
	      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default Counter;
	
	```
	In this code:
	
	-   We import React, `useState`, and `useCallback` from 'react'.
	    
	-   Inside the `Counter` component, we declare a state variable `count` to hold the current count and an event handler function `setCount` to update the count.
	    
	-   We create two memoized event handlers, `increment` and `decrement`, using `useCallback`. These event handlers update the count state by incrementing and decrementing it, respectively.
	    
	-   We provide the `useCallback` hook with a dependency array. In this case, the dependency array contains the `count` variable, which indicates that the event handlers should only be recreated if the `count` value changes.
	    
	-   In the component's JSX, we display the current count and two buttons with the memoized event handlers for increment and decrement.
	    
	
	By using `useCallback`, the event handlers are memoized and only recreated when the `count` variable changes. This optimization prevents unnecessary re-renders and can be especially useful in scenarios where you pass these functions as props to child components. It helps improve the performance of your React applications by ensuring that functions remain consistent and do not cause unnecessary re-renders.

10. ### useMemo
	`useMemo` is a React Hook that memoizes a value based on a function and a list of dependencies. It calculates the value once and then returns that memoized value on subsequent renders unless one of the dependencies has changed. This can be particularly useful when you need to optimize the calculation of derived data, heavy computations, or data transformations.
	
	**Example of `useMemo` in React**
	
	In this example, we'll create a simple React component that calculates the factorial of a number using `useMemo` to optimize the computation:
	
	```javascript
	import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
	
	function FactorialCalculator({ number }) {
	  const factorial = useMemo(() => calculateFactorial(number), [number]);
	
	  function calculateFactorial(n) {
	    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
	      return 1;
	    }
	    return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
	  }
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <p>Factorial of {number} is {factorial}</p>
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default FactorialCalculator;
	
	```
	
	In this code:
	
	-   We import React, `useState`, and `useMemo` from 'react'.
	    
	-   Inside the `FactorialCalculator` component, we receive a `number` prop, which is the input for which we want to calculate the factorial.
	    
	-   We use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of the `calculateFactorial` function. The first argument to `useMemo` is a function that performs the calculation, and the second argument is an array of dependencies. In this case, the dependency is the `number` prop. The value is calculated only when the `number` prop changes.
	    
	-   The `calculateFactorial` function is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number.
	    
	-   In the component's JSX, we display the calculated factorial.
	    
	
	By using `useMemo`, we ensure that the `factorial` value is calculated only when the `number` prop changes. If the `number` prop remains the same between renders, the memoized `factorial` value is reused, preventing unnecessary re-computation and improving the performance of the component.
	
	`useMemo` is especially valuable when you have expensive computations or data transformations in your components. It optimizes your application by ensuring that calculations are performed only when necessary and reusing previously calculated results when the dependencies don't change.

11. ###  useLocation

	The `useLocation` hook is commonly used in React applications that use the `react-router-dom` library for client-side routing. It provides access to the current location object, allowing you to examine and work with the various parts of the URL, such as the pathname and search parameters. This is useful for creating dynamic UIs and navigation based on the current URL.
		
	**Example of `useLocation` in React**
		
	Suppose you have a React application that uses `react-router-dom` for routing. Here's how you can use the `useLocation` hook to access and display the current pathname and search parameters in your component:
	
	First, make sure to install `react-router-dom` if you haven't already:
		
	```javascript
		npm install react-router-dom
	```
	Now, let's create a simple component that uses the `useLocation` hook:
	
	```javascript
	import React from 'react';
	import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
	
	function CurrentLocation() {
	  // Use the useLocation hook to access the current location object
	  const location = useLocation();
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <h2>Current Location Details:</h2>
	      <p>Pathname: {location.pathname}</p>
	      <p>Search Params: {location.search}</p>
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default CurrentLocation;
	
	```
	In this example:
	
	-   We import `useLocation` from `'react-router-dom'`.
	    
	-   Inside the `CurrentLocation` component, we use the `useLocation` hook to access the current location object, which contains information about the URL.
	    
	-   We then display the current pathname and search parameters from the location object in the component.
	    
	
	Remember to use this component within a `Router` context provided by `react-router-dom` so that the `useLocation` hook can access the current route information. When the route changes, the `CurrentLocation` component will automatically reflect the updated URL information.
	
	This is just a simple example, but you can use the `useLocation` hook to create more complex navigation and UI features based on the current URL in your React application.
		
	**[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12. ###  useHistory
	
	The `useHistory` hook is part of the `react-router-dom` library and provides a way to interact with the browser's history and navigate between routes programmatically in a React application. It's particularly useful for implementing dynamic navigation, redirecting users, and performing actions based on user interactions.
		
	**Example of `useHistory` in React**
		
	Suppose you have a simple React application that uses `react-router-dom` for routing. Here's how you can use the `useHistory` hook to programmatically navigate to different routes based on user interactions:
	
	First, ensure you have `react-router-dom` installed:
		
	```javascript
		npm install react-router-dom
	```
	Now, let's create a component that uses the `useHistory` hook:
	
	```javascript
	import React from 'react';
	import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
	
	function NavigationExample() {
	  // Use the useHistory hook to get access to the history object
	  const history = useHistory();
	
	  const navigateToAbout = () => {
	    // Programmatically navigate to the '/about' route
	    history.push('/about');
	  };
	
	  const goBack = () => {
	    // Navigate back in the browser's history
	    history.goBack();
	  };
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <h2>Navigation Example</h2>
	      <button onClick={navigateToAbout}>Go to About</button>
	      <button onClick={goBack}>Go Back</button>
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default NavigationExample;
	
	```
	
	In this example:
	
	-   We import `useHistory` from `'react-router-dom'`.
	    
	-   Inside the `NavigationExample` component, we use the `useHistory` hook to get access to the `history` object.
	    
	-   We define two functions: `navigateToAbout` and `goBack`. When the buttons are clicked, these functions use the `history` object to perform navigation actions.
	    
	-   `navigateToAbout` uses `history.push('/about')` to programmatically navigate to the '/about' route.
	    
	-   `goBack` uses `history.goBack()` to navigate back in the browser's history stack.
	    
	
	Make sure that this component is used within a `Router` context provided by `react-router-dom` to access the `history` object properly. The `useHistory` hook allows you to create dynamic and interactive navigation elements in your React application.

13. ###  useParams
	
	The `useParams` hook is part of the `react-router-dom` library and provides a way to access URL parameters defined in your routes. URL parameters are placeholders in your route patterns that can capture dynamic values from the URL and make them available in your components. This is useful for building components that rely on dynamic data from the URL.
		
	**Example of `useParams` in React**
		
	
	Suppose you have a React application with a route that includes a dynamic URL parameter, such as a product ID. You can use the `useParams` hook to access and use that parameter in your component:
	
	First, ensure you have `react-router-dom` installed:

  	```javascript
		npm install react-router-dom
	```
	Now, let's create a component that uses the `useParams` hook:

	```javascript
	import React from 'react';
	import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
	
	function ProductDetail() {
	  // Use the useParams hook to access URL parameters
	  const { productId } = useParams();
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <h2>Product Detail</h2>
	      <p>Product ID: {productId}</p>
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	export default ProductDetail;
	
	```
	In this example:
	
	-   We import `useParams` from `'react-router-dom'`.
	    
	-   Inside the `ProductDetail` component, we use the `useParams` hook to access URL parameters. In this case, we're capturing the `productId` parameter from the URL.
	    
	-   We display the value of the `productId` parameter in the component, allowing you to use it for data retrieval, rendering, or any other purpose.
	    
	
	To use this component and see it in action, you would define a route in your routing configuration that includes a dynamic URL parameter, like this:
	
	```javascript
	import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
	
	function App() {
	  return (
	    <BrowserRouter>
	      <Switch>
	        <Route path="/products/:productId">
	          <ProductDetail />
	        </Route>
	      </Switch>
	    </BrowserRouter>
	  );
	}
	```
	In this route configuration, the `:productId` part of the route pattern captures the dynamic product ID from the URL. The `ProductDetail` component can then access and use this ID via the `useParams` hook.
	
	Using the `useParams` hook in combination with dynamic routes allows you to create components that adapt to different URL parameters and provide dynamic content based on the current route.

14. ###  useTransition

	In React 18's concurrent mode, the `useTransition` function is used to handle the transition between different render states. Concurrent mode allows React to work on multiple tasks concurrently, making applications more responsive and efficient.
	
	The `useTransition` function is typically used to wrap asynchronous operations, such as data fetching, to provide a smoother user experience. It helps manage the transition between loading and rendering data by allowing you to show loading indicators or placeholders while data is being fetched, and then smoothly transitioning to the actual data when it's ready.
		
	**Example of `useTransition` in React**
		
	Here's a conceptual example of how `useTransition` might be used in a React 18 application, although please note that this example does not reflect the actual API (as of my last update) but illustrates the concept:
		
	```javascript
	import React, { useTransition } from 'react';
	
	function AsyncDataFetchingComponent() {
	  const [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition();
	
	  const fetchData = async () => {
	    startTransition(() => {
	      // While fetching data, you can show a loading indicator or placeholder.
	      // React will manage the transition smoothly.
	      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
	        .then((response) => response.json())
	        .then((data) => {
	          // Update the component state with the fetched data.
	          // React will transition to displaying the data.
	        });
	    });
	  };
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <button onClick={fetchData}>Fetch Data</button>
	      {isPending ? <LoadingIndicator /> : <DataDisplay />}
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	```
	In this conceptual example:
	
	-   We use the `useTransition` hook to start a transition.
	    
	-   When fetching data, React can show a loading indicator (`LoadingIndicator`) while transitioning to the data display (`DataDisplay`) when it's ready.
	    
	
	It's important to recognize that the example provided here is a simplified concept. In practice, utilizing `useTransition` and concurrent mode in React 18 may necessitate more intricate implementation and considerations. To ensure you are following the most current and effective practices, it is advisable to consult the latest React documentation and available resources.
	
	**[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
	
15. ###  useDeferredValue

	The `useDeferredValue` hook is designed to manage when a value is transitioned from being "deferred" to being "current." In React's concurrent mode, when you have expensive or non-urgent data or computations, you can defer their processing to avoid blocking the main thread. This can lead to a more responsive user interface.
	
	`useDeferredValue` is often used in combination with `useTransition`. You can specify which data should be deferred and when it should become "current," allowing React to optimize the timing of rendering and transitions.
		
	**Example of `useDeferredValue` in React**
		
	Here's a simplified example of how `useDeferredValue` might be used, although it should be considered a conceptual representation:
	
	```javascript
	import React, { useDeferredValue, useTransition } from 'react';
	
	function DeferredDataComponent() {
	  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
	
	  // Simulate expensive data fetching (replace with actual asynchronous operation)
	  const fetchData = async () => {
	    startTransition(() => {
	      // Deferring the processing of data
	      const deferredData = someExpensiveDataProcessing();
	
	      // Declare which data should be deferred
	      const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(deferredData);
	
	      // React will optimize when to make deferredValue "current"
	      // based on the rendering and transition priorities.
	    });
	  };
	
	  return (
	    <div>
	      <button onClick={fetchData}>Fetch Data</button>
	      {isPending ? <LoadingIndicator /> : <DataDisplay />}
	    </div>
	  );
	}
	
	```
	
	In this conceptual example:
	
	-   We use `useDeferredValue` to indicate that the `deferredData` should be transitioned to a "current" state when it's appropriate according to React's concurrent mode logic.
	    
	-   We use `useTransition` to manage the transition and indicate that some part of the rendering is pending.
	    
	-   While data is being processed, we can show a loading indicator (`LoadingIndicator`) and transition smoothly to the data display (`DataDisplay`) when the data becomes "current."
	    
	
	Please note that this example is a simplified illustration of the concept of `useDeferredValue`. The actual use and behavior of `useDeferredValue` may be more complex and require consideration of concurrent mode principles. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on `useDeferredValue` and concurrent mode, refer to the latest React documentation and resources.

16. ###  Custom Hooks

	A custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses built-in hooks or other custom hooks to manage and share stateful logic. Custom hooks are typically used to abstract complex behavior or state management so that it can be reused across multiple components. They follow a naming convention with the "use" prefix to indicate that they are hooks.
	
	Custom hooks can be used for a variety of purposes, such as data fetching, form handling, managing local storage, or any other functionality that involves state or side effects. They help keep components clean and focused by extracting logic into separate, reusable functions.
	
	**Example of a Custom Hook**
	
	```javascript
	import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
	
	function useWindowDimensions() {
	  const [windowDimensions, setWindowDimensions] = useState({
	    width: window.innerWidth,
	    height: window.innerHeight,
	  });
	
	  useEffect(() => {
	    function handleResize() {
	      setWindowDimensions({
	        width: window.innerWidth,
	        height: window.innerHeight,
	      });
	    }
	
	    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
	
	    return () => {
	      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
	    };
	  }, []);
	
	  return windowDimensions;
	}
	
	export default useWindowDimensions;
	
	```
	
	In this code:
	
	-   We create a custom `useWindowDimensions` hook that uses `useState` to manage the window dimensions (width and height).
	    
	-   We use `useEffect` to add a resize event listener that updates the window dimensions when the window is resized.
	    
	-   The hook returns the current window dimensions.
	    
	
	By using this custom hook, you can access and respond to window dimensions in your components to create responsive and dynamic layouts.
